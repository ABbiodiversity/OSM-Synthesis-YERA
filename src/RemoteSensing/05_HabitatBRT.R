#Idea here is to do a BRT using all the data together (maybe a subset would be better)
#to get an idea of what "Yellow Rail habitat" looks like. Then use the BRT to predict in each year
#whether the habitat got better or worse, and see if that correlates with occupancy changes.

#Could use the BRT to estimate a "delta" for each year, and plug that into the colonization and
#extinction of the occupancy model and see if it improves fit. Would expect colonization to be
#positively related to delta, and extinction to be negatively correlated.
